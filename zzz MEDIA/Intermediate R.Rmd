knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Today we are going to go step-by-step through a typical Booth workflow for a regression problem. The steps involved will be:  
  
1. Loading the Data  
2. Understanding the Data  
3. Cleaning the Data  
4. Performing Analysis  
5. Visualizing the Results  

The dataset we will be working with today is the "mtcars" dataset, which comes preloaded with RStudio. You can load it anytime to practice by simply referencing it in R:
```{r}
print(mtcars)
```

That said, I have a slightly modified version that we will use to practice some concepts. Download it here:
